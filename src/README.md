### Description

This program simulates a Mind Alive [Oasis Pro Cranio-Electro Stimulation ](https://mindalive.com/products/oasis-pro) device through the use of C++ and the QT framework.

A CES (Cranio-Electro Stimulation) is a non-invasive neuro-stimulation medical device that delivers a microcurrent via small electrode clips through the earlobes to stimulate the brain for the purpose of therapeutic intervention.

Therapeutic sessions modulating specific regions of neurons have been proven to effectively treat conditions such as insomnia, anxiety, depression, as well as alleviate pain and improve cognition.

The microcurrent flowing through the earclips is tiny (millionths of an ampere) which most people hardly feel as the brain naturally produces electrical currents within this range.

All functionalities of the CES including turning the device On/Off, selecting a session, determining session length, intensity manipulation, and recording a session are replicated in this program which can be launched using the instructions featured below.

Project documentation can be found in the [Docs](https://github.com/NebulaCo/ECSS/tree/docs/docs) folder.
