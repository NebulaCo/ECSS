### Description

This program simulates a Mind Alive [Oasis Pro Cranio-Electro Stimulation ](https://mindalive.com/products/oasis-pro) device through the use of C++ and the QT framework.

A CES (Cranio-Electro Stimulation) is a non-invasive neuro-stimulation medical device that delivers microcurrent via an electrode through the earlobes to stimulate the brain for the purpose of therapeutic intervention.

All functionalities of the CES including turning On/Off, selecting a session, determining session length, intensity manipulation, and recording a session are replicated in this program which can be launched using the instructions featured below.

Project documentation can be found in the [Docs](https://github.com/NebulaCo/ECSS/tree/docs/docs) folder.
